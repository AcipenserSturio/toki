# nasin mi | my style

I've been using Toki Pona since mid 2019. In my time, I have accrued an opinionated style that I would like to document here.

My style is phrased as instructions, but readers are free to adopt or disregard these points.

(Note: my fluency level is not advanced in every regard. I focus on smaller texts, translation/adaptation, but I've done relatively little listening, speaking live, or translating large bodies of text. For example, I understand the kalama sin podcast, but it requires concentration, otherwise I might lose the thread of conversation. Nevertheless, I hope my experience may be useful to some.)

## Phonology

### Onsets

- Avoid aspirated plosives, even though the phonology is broad enough to allow them.

- For Russians: do not velarise your /l/. In particular, /le/ \[lˠɛ] sounds really off.

- Avoid \[ɾ] for /l/ - it is cute in principle, but in practice I've only heard it in songs using Vocaloids.

- I have a slight preference for dental/laminal \[t̪] over alveolar/apical \[t], but I am biased by my L1.

### Coda n

- Assimilate coda n: np > \[mp], nk > \[ŋk]. I've seen people intentionally choose not to assimilate, and it never stops being weird.

- Assimilate across word boundaries too: lo\[m p]oka, ta[ŋ k]ulupu.

- nj is \[ɲj], not \[ɲ].

- No strong opinions about \[nw].

- Don't overthink the timing. The mora analysis can mislead you into treating n as a separate syllable; it is not.

### Tokiponisation

- \[v] > w, not p.

- \[sp st sk] > almost always p t k, not s. The community at large probably disagrees and says this should be chosen on a case by case basis.

- I'm of the opinion Deutsch > Tosi is an example of epenthesis (tʃ > si), not metathesis (js > sj > si). I'll prefer this interpretation even if someone confirms metathesis was the original intent.

- For English: stick to /əɹ/ > a, which is in line with German and Japanese.

- For English: stick to /əl/ > o or u. For example, Google /gʉwgəl/ > Kuko sounds fine, Kuke does not.

## Grammar

- Don't use kepeken e.

- Avoid "pilin pona/ike" in favour of "pona/ike lon pilin mi".

- Avoid "pona/ike lukin" in favour of "pona/ike tawa lukin mi".

- Don't use transitive prepositional phrases unless they're super necessary.

- "A li toki tawa B" vibes more like a monologue; for normal conversations try to use "A en B li toki".

## Lexicon

- Do not just stick to "all words in a given list / category". There are unhelpful words that a lot of people use; there are cool words that are hardly known. Pick and choose.

### Common words

- The joke of kijetesantakalu is that it is pointlessly specific and pointlessly long - shortening "kijetesantakalu" to "kije" or expanding its meaning makes it not funny anymore.

- kipisi is good actually. I don't like it when tu means both to duplicate and to half. Stealing "particle" from wan/lili is nice too.

### Uncommon words

- Do not use epiku. It's "cool factor" is long gone. Try to interject "wawa" and "pona" instead.

- Avoid jasima. It is never obvious how to correctly interpret a sentence with jasima.

- Avoid kokosila, but maybe start using penpo.

- People who use meso should be more informed that jan Olipija wanted a way to "[describe hard of hearing as neither hearing nor deaf](https://discord.com/channels/301377942062366741/375591429608570881/771930006539862036)" - treating it as a generic "middle, uncertain, undecided" word imo misses the point. For a similar word, check out "eliki".

- majuna is neat.

### Obscure words

- apeja, kiki, usawi are cool words.

  - apeja is helpful to be more emotive in creative works. Also I learned the language at a time when apeja was more accepted.

  - kiki is a specific example of human experience-driven words, which I really dig. (Also see puwa and words coined by ilo Powa.)

- The owe meme is a beaten horse, avoid it in favour of something newer and more fun.

- soto/teje are never needed - you just need to be more creative and thoughtful about *why* you ever want "right/left".

### Sandbox words

- Do not use alu.

  - It [comes from an outdated take on la-transformations](https://discord.com/channels/301377942062366741/375591429608570881/559764654017216522).

  - It is entirely replaceable with "lon ..." and "tan ni: ...". (Sometimes other prepositions.)

- Do not use lo (previously known as lu).

  - It claims to be a "preposition particle"; linguistically that's nonsensical, it's basically a preposition.

  - As a preposition, it is simultaneously way too vague (does not narrow down the meaning on its own) and way too precise (excludes tawa/lon/tan/sama/kepeken).

  - It mimics the natlang process of creating a preposition out of content words: "in opposition to", "in exchange of". Natlangs do that as the semantics of existing prepositions get "bleached", and more precise prepositions are needed. This does not happen in Toki Pona, so preposition-derivation is not needed.

  - There are very few examples of "useful" prepositions formed this way, and those are easily replaced by lon + noun phrase, like how lon anpa/sewi/poka/weka/etc already work.

## sitelen pona

- Do not use punctuation.

- Do not use "extended glyphs".

- Avoid using compound glyphs, even though they are pu.

- Use a typical down-ni everywhere, including for "ni:".

- Use four-legged akesi.

- Use pepper-namako.
